# Google-Play-Store-Apps-Dataset-Visualization
This project was created by using the knowledge acquired from the [Complete Data Science & Machine Learning Bootcamp in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-science-bootcamp-in-python/) on Udemy. In this course, I learned how to get started in data science by using NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Dask, LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, Streamlit, Power BI & much more.
# Visualization with [MatPlotLib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib).
For the first project, a dataset [googleplaystore.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) was used which includes information about data of 10k Play Store apps for analysing the Android market. In this project, different methods of visualization such as scatterplot, pie chart, histogram, etc. were used and 2 methods of subplot creation (by using plt from matplotlib and axes were applied).
